## What problem are you trying to solve?

School shootings! (and the solution doesn't have any thing to do with guns!)

I came across [this article](https://www.rd.com/advice/parenting/stop-bullying-strategy/) a few years ago (around the time of the [Parkland shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoneman_Douglas_High_School_shooting) happened if I remember correctly) and I was very touched! As a software developer, my immediate thought was "hey! I can automate this and make the teachers' life easier!" 

I do believe that, even though I might not fully understand the gun-control laws, NRA and all the politics and history, it doesn't mean I could only sit around and do nothing. 


## How does it work?

- Create a google spreadsheet with 2 sheets named _Names_ and _Result_
    - inside the _Names_ sheet, list all the names of your students as shown in the screenshot.
     

## Why is the project called Bluewhale*s*52?

There is [a very lonely whale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52-hertz_whale) who sings at an unusual frequency of 52-hertz, which is a much higher pitch than that of the other whale species with migration patterns most closely resembling this whale's – the blue whale (10–39 Hz) or fin whale (20 Hz). It has been detected regularly in many locations since the late 1980s and appears to be the only individual emitting a whale call at this frequency. It has been described as the "world's loneliest whale". 

I named this project _Bluewhale*s*52_ because 1. I hope this project helps identify the potentially lonely students in a class and 2. I hope they also find others similar to themselves so they don't feel lonely any more.
